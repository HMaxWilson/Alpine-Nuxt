          Leading the team is founder and owner David, who has over 30-years-experience in the building trade and
          expertise in all areas of building work and project management. He’s meticulous in his work, tenacious in
          his approach and no challenge is too big or small for Dave. “There’s always ways and means” is one of the
          favourites of Dave's (many!) catchphrases , and when he’s not out building an extension somewhere you’ll
          find him cruising the ‘mean streets’ of Hertfordshire on his Triumph Speedmaster.

          Whilst Dave and Brad are busy doing the physical building work, Tracey takes care of the administrative
          'heavy lifting'. From working with the quantity surveyor to put together job estimates, to responding to
          emails and dealing with suppliers, Tracey is always busy working away in the background to help a customer
          and support the team. She's also an expert at chasing unpaid invoices - you have been warned!

          Following closely in his father’s footsteps, Brad is a qualified carpenter and joiner with over 10 years
          experience in the building trade. He’s a real ‘people person’ and loves nothing more than getting stuck in
          and helping customers with their projects. Brad is also a keen motorcyclist and when he’s not out on his
          bike you’ll find him out on his mountain bike or playing football.
